## Development Dependencies

We welcome [discussion on our community](http://community.respoke.io/) and contributions from the
community. To get started contributing back, you'll need to clone this repo and run the following
commands.

```
brew install node
# or
# apt-get install nodejs
npm install -g grunt
npm install
```

## Tests

Tests currently cannot run outside of our internal development infrastructure.

### Compilation
Transporter uses CommonJS to manage its dependencies, and the [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
module bundler to bundle the library. To create the bundled and minified library suitable for
distribution, you can run

```
grunt dist
```

or

```
webpack && npm run build-stats
```

If you want to have the source files watched and built automatically when changes are made, run

```
webpack --watch
```

If you want the watch task to rebuild faster, you can comment out the uglify plugin in
`webpack.config.js` for the duration of your development.

### Code Compliance

This project uses jshint.  The configuration for jshint can be found in the repo at `.jshintrc` and `.jshintignore`.

```
npm run jshint
```

Point your editor to `.jscsrc` to follow the project's
[JavaScript Code Style (JSCS)](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs) rules.

```
npm run jscs
```
